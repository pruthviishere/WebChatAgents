Let's break down your project's architecture, design patterns, and adherence to best practices based on the provided code.

**Features:**

* **Website Analysis:** Extracts key business information (industry, size, location, products/services, technologies used, founding year) from a given website URL.  Uses web scraping and OpenAI's GPT model for analysis.
* **Company Questions:** Allows users to ask specific questions about a company.  Answers are derived either from the extracted website data or by performing a DuckDuckGo search and using GPT to synthesize an answer.
* **Direct AI Questions:**  Allows users to ask general questions directly to the GPT model, without website context.  Provides a temperature setting to control response creativity.

**API Endpoints:**

* `/api/analyze`: (POST) Analyzes a website.  Input: `{"url": "https://example.com"}`. Output: `BusinessDetails` model (JSON). Requires API key authentication.
* `/api/analyze/question`: (POST) Answers a question about a company. Input: `{"url": "https://example.com", "question": "What industry are they in?"}`. Output: `QuestionResponse` model (JSON). Requires API key authentication.
* `/api/analyze/direct-question`: (POST) Asks a direct question to GPT. Input: `{"question": "What is the capital of France?", "temperature": 0.5}`. Output: `DirectQuestionResponse` model (JSON). Requires API key authentication.
* `/health`: (GET) Health check endpoint.

**Data Flow Through API:**

1. **Request:**  The client sends a request to one of the API endpoints.
2. **Authentication:** The API key is verified.
3. **Caching:** The application checks for cached data in the JSON database.
4. **Extraction/Search:** If data isn't cached:
    * `/analyze`: Website content is extracted using BeautifulSoup or Playwright.
    * `/analyze/question`: If the answer isn't in the extracted data, a DuckDuckGo search is performed.
5. **LLM Analysis:**
    * `/analyze`: Extracted website content is sent to GPT to generate `BusinessDetails`.
    * `/analyze/question`: Search results (or extracted data) and the question are sent to GPT to generate an answer.
    * `/api/analyze/direct-question`:  The question is sent directly to GPT.
6. **Response:**  The generated JSON response is returned to the client.
7. **Caching (Post-Response):** New data and answers are cached in the JSON database.

**External Services/Libraries:**

* **OpenAI GPT (gpt-4o-mini):**  Used for all AI-powered analysis and question answering.
* **BeautifulSoup:**  Used for basic website scraping.
* **Playwright:** Used for scraping dynamic, JavaScript-heavy websites.
* **DuckDuckGo Search API:** Used for web searches.
* **FastAPI:**  Web framework for building the API.
* **Pydantic:** Data validation and serialization.
* **Streamlit:** Framework for the frontend UI.
* **Requests:**  HTTP library.
* **Uvicorn/Gunicorn:**  ASGI/WSGI servers.

**Design Patterns:**

* **Factory Pattern (`ExtractorFactory`, `SearchServiceFactory`):**  Used for creating different types of extractors and search services without specifying the concrete class.
* **Dependency Injection (FastAPI's `Depends`):** Used for injecting dependencies like the API key verification function.  Improves code modularity and testability.

**SOLID Principles:**

The code generally follows SOLID principles, especially with the introduction of the `DatabaseInterface` and its implementation `JsonDatabase`. This allows for easy swapping of database implementations in the future.  However, there's room for improvement in other areas:

* **Single Responsibility Principle:**  Some functions could be broken down further to improve clarity and maintainability (e.g., parts of the `analyze_website_endpoint`).
* **Open/Closed Principle:**  The extractor selection logic could be made more extensible without requiring code modifications if new extractor types are added.

**Inheritance:**

The `WebExtractor` abstract base class and its concrete implementations (`BeautifulSoupExtractor`, `PlaywrightExtractor`) demonstrate the use of inheritance.  This provides a clear structure for adding new extraction methods.

**Docker Support:**

Yes, the project has excellent Docker support, using `docker-compose` to orchestrate the API and UI containers. The Dockerfiles are well-structured and use multi-stage builds for the UI to keep image sizes smaller.

**Best Practices:**

* **Logging:**  Good use of logging throughout the application.
* **Error Handling:** Basic error handling is in place, but could be more robust in some areas.
* **Configuration:** Uses `.env` files and `pydantic-settings` for managing configuration.
* **Caching:**  Implements caching to improve performance.

**Areas for Improvement:**

* **More Robust Error Handling:**  Implement more specific error handling and potentially retry mechanisms for external API calls (OpenAI, DuckDuckGo).
* **Testing:**  The project mentions `pytest`, but more comprehensive tests would be beneficial.
* **Documentation:**  While the README is good, adding docstrings to all functions and modules would improve code maintainability.
* **Input Validation:** More thorough validation of user inputs (URLs, questions) could prevent unexpected errors.

**LLM Integration, DuckDuckGo, and Extractors:**

Your project effectively integrates LLMs (OpenAI GPT) with web search (DuckDuckGo) and web extraction (BeautifulSoup and Playwright) to provide valuable insights from websites.  The extractor selection logic chooses between BeautifulSoup and Playwright based on the complexity of the target website.  DuckDuckGo is used as the primary search engine, with a potential fallback to a different search provider (SerpAPI based on your code though not configured).


You've covered the main features well.  Here are a few potential additions or refinements you could consider, along with more detailed technical explanations of your existing analysis functionality:

**Technical Deep Dive into Analysis Functionality:**

**1. `/api/analyze` (Website Analysis):**

* **Input:** Website URL.
* **Process:**
    1. **Extractor Selection:**  The `ExtractorService` dynamically chooses between `BeautifulSoupExtractor` (for simpler sites) and `PlaywrightExtractor` (for JavaScript-heavy sites).  This decision is based on regex patterns matching common SPA frameworks and e-commerce platforms in the URL.
    2. **Content Extraction:** The chosen extractor retrieves the website's HTML content, title, meta description, and meta keywords.  Script and style tags are removed to clean the text content.  The extracted text is truncated to 8000 characters to stay within LLM token limits.
    3. **LLM Analysis (OpenAI GPT):** The extracted content, along with the website URL, is sent to the `gpt_call` function.  The prompt instructs GPT to act as a business analyst and extract the following information according to the `BusinessDetails` schema: company name, industry, company size, location, description, products/services, technologies used, and founding year.
    4. **Response Parsing:** The JSON response from GPT is parsed into a `BusinessDetails` Pydantic model.  This ensures data integrity and provides clear error messages if the LLM's output doesn't conform to the expected schema.
    5. **Caching:**  The extracted `BusinessDetails` are stored in the JSON database to avoid redundant scraping and LLM calls.
* **Output:** `BusinessDetails` model (JSON).

**2. `/api/analyze/question` (Company Questions):**

* **Input:** Website URL and question.
* **Process:**
    1. **Cache Check:**  The system checks if the answer to this question has already been cached.
    2. **Company Data Retrieval:** If the company data isn't cached, a full website analysis is performed using `/api/analyze`.
    3. **Direct Answer Extraction:** The system attempts to answer the question directly from the extracted `BusinessDetails` using keyword matching within the question.  If a direct answer is found, it's returned with a confidence score derived from the relevant `BusinessDetails` field.
    4. **Web Search (DuckDuckGo):**  If a direct answer isn't found, a DuckDuckGo search is performed using the `DuckDuckGoSearchService`. The query is cleaned and formatted to improve search results. Multiple search attempts are made with different parameters if needed.
    5. **LLM Analysis (OpenAI GPT):** The search results and the original question are sent to GPT.  The prompt instructs GPT to synthesize an answer based on the search results and any available company context.
    6. **Response Parsing and Caching:** The LLM's JSON response is parsed, cached, and returned.
* **Output:** `QuestionResponse` model (JSON).

**3. `/api/analyze/direct-question` (Direct AI Questions):**

* **Input:** Question and temperature.
* **Process:**
    1. **LLM Prompting (OpenAI GPT):** The question is sent directly to GPT. The temperature parameter controls the randomness of the response. A lower temperature results in more focused and deterministic answers, while a higher temperature allows for more creative and potentially less predictable outputs.  The prompt explicitly asks for a JSON response containing the answer and a confidence score.
    2. **Response Parsing:**  GPT's JSON response is parsed into a `DirectQuestionResponse` model.
* **Output:**  `DirectQuestionResponse` model (JSON).
